# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App as a test task for GoIt Technical Boost.
This project has two routes: / and /tweets.
HomePage has a link to TweetsPage, where user can see the tweets cards of all users existing in mockApi.
All card has a button that can subscribe to somebody's tweets(the number of followers is increased). You can also unsubscribe if you want(the number of followers is decreased).
TweetsPage has a pagination which is implemented by adding a button "Load More": 1 page show only 12 tweets cards.

The additional task with filtering will be done as soon as possible
